    "description": "Nearly half a century ago, Judy Collins recorded her mega-hit \u201cBoth Sides, Now\u201d\u2014an anthem of the \u201960s written for her by Joni Mitchell. Collins won further acclaim with \u201cChelsea Morning\u201d and \u201cSend in the Clowns.\u201d The singer known as \u201cJudy Blue Eyes\u201d also confronted the dark side of the \u201960s as well as her own personal struggles. Throughout, she has remained an outspoken activist who began singing Pete Seeger\u2019s protest song, \u201cWhere Have All the Flowers Gone?\u201d while testifying at the 1969 trial of the Chicago Seven. Now this enduring and courageous artist looks back at the decade that launched, inspired, and tested her.\n\nJudy Collins is a multiple Grammy-winning folk icon and a champion of Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger. Harold Holzer (moderator), a prolific author and historian, has appeared on stage with Judy Collins at many venues, including Ford\u2019s Theatre, Cooper Union, and the Daniel Chester French studio in Stockbridge, MA.\n\nPresented\u00a0in collaboration with the\u00a0Center for Women\u2019s History\u00a0at the New-York\u00a0Historical Society",
