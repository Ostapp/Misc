Despite sixty years of relentless campaigning by suffrage organizations, by 1913 only six states allowed women to vote. Then Alice Paul came to Washington, D.C. She planned a grand spectacle on Pennsylvania Avenue on the day before Woodrow Wilson\u2019s inauguration\u2013marking the beginning of a more aggressive strategy on the part of the women\u2019s suffrage movement. Groups of women protested and picketed outside the White House, and some were thrown into jail. Newspapers across the nation covered their activities. These tactics finally led to the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920. Author Rebecca Boggs Roberts narrates the heroic struggle of Alice Paul and the National Woman\u2019s Party as they worked to earn the vote.",

He then served as Aide-de-Camp to Lieutenant General Stanley McChrystal during McChrystal\u2019s final year commanding a Joint Special Operations Task Force fighting Al Qaeda around the globe. Too often, companies end up with teams stuck in their own silos, pursuing goals and metrics in isolation. Their traditional autocratic structures create stability, scalability, and predictability \u2014 but in a world that demands constant adaptation, this traditional model fails. In\u00a0 , retired four-star General Stanley McChrystal and former Navy SEAL Chris Fussell made the case for a new organizational model combining the agility, adaptability, and cohesion of a small team with the power and resources of a giant organization. Now, in\u00a0 Fussell channels all his experiences, both military and corporate, into powerful strategies for unifying isolated and distrustful teams. This practical guide will help leaders in any field implement the\u00a0 \u00a0approach to tear down their silos, improve collaboration, and avoid turf wars. By committing to one higher mission, organizations develop an overall capability that far exceeds the sum of their parts. From Silicon Valley software giant Intuit to a government agency on the plains of Oklahoma, organizations have used Fussell\u2019s methods to unite their people around a single compelling vision, resulting in superior performance.\u00a0 will help you follow their example to a more agile and resilient future.",

    "description": "Robin Chase\u00a0is cofounder of Zipcar, along with three other companies (Veniam, Buzzcar, and GoLoco). She was named one of\u00a0 \u2018s 100 Most Influential People in the World, a\u00a0 \u00a0Top Ten Designer, a\u00a0 \u00a0Champion of Innovation, and has been featured in the\u00a0 , NPR, NBC\u2019s\u00a0 , and\u00a0 . She was shortlisted for the 2015 Thinkers50 Breakthrough Idea and Ideas into Practice awards. She lives in Cambridge, MA. Robin Chase, co-founder and first CEO of Zipcar, the world\u2019s largest car sharing company, illuminates the profound economic and business potential of the shared economy, showing how combining two powerful forces \u2013 the platform of the \u201cInc\u201d and the under-utilized talents, energy and creativity of the \u201cPeers\u201d \u2013 can transform the economy, redefine business, and create a future of abundance and prosperity. When Robin Chase cofounded Zipcar, she not only started a business but established the foundation for one of the most important economic and social ideas of our time: the collaborative economy. With this important book, she broadens our thinking about the ways in which the economy is being transformed and shows how the Peers Inc model is changing the very nature of capitalism. When the best of people power is combined with the best of corporate power to form \u201cPeers Inc\u201d organizations, a potent creative force is released. The \u201cInc\u201d in these collaborations delivers the industrial strengths of significant scale and resources, and the \u201cPeers\u201d bring together the individual strengths of localization, specialization, and customization, unlocking the power of the collaborative economy. When excess capacity is harnessed by the platform and diverse peers participate, a completely new dynamic is unleashed. In\u00a0 , Robin Chase brings her provocative insights to work, business, the economy, and the environment, showing: \n\u2022How focusing on excess capacity transforms the economics of what\u2019s possible and delivers abundance to all \n\u2022How the new collaboration between the Inc and the Peers enables companies to grow more quickly, learn faster, and deliver smarter products and services \n\u2022How leveraging the Peers Inc model can address climate change with the necessary speed and scale \n\u2022How the Peers Inc model can help legacy companies overcome their shortening life cycle by inviting innovation and evolution \n\u2022Why power parity between the Peers and the Inc is a prerequisite for long-term success \n\u2022How platforms can be built within the existing financial system or outside of it \n\u2022What government can do to enhance economic possibility and protect people working in this new decentralized world Chase casts a wide net, illuminating the potential of the Peers Inc model to address broader issues such as climate change and income inequality, and proves the impact that this innovative economic force can have on the most pressing issues of our time.",

In Ukraine, unknown hackers shut off electricity to nearly 230,000 people for six hours. North Korean hackers destroyed networks at Sony Pictures in retaliation for a film that mocked Kim Jong-un. And Russian cyberattackers leaked Democratic National Committee emails in an attempt to sway a U.S. presidential election. And yet despite such documented risks, government agencies, whose investigations and surveillance are stymied by encryption, push for a weakening of protections. In this accessible and riveting read, Susan Landau makes a compelling case for the need to secure our data, explaining how we must maintain cybersecurity in an insecure age.",

The idea of artificial intelligence\u2013job-killing robots, self-driving cars, and self-managing organizations\u2013captures the imagination, evoking a combination of wonder and dread for those of us who will have to deal with the consequences. But what if it\u2019s not quite so complicated? The real job of artificial intelligence, argue these three eminent economists, is to lower the cost of prediction. And once you start talking about costs, you can use some well\u2010established economics to cut through the hype. The constant challenge for all managers is to make decisions under uncertainty. And AI contributes by making knowing what\u2019s coming in the future cheaper and more certain. But decision making has another component: judgment, which is firmly in the realm of humans, not machines. Making prediction cheaper means that we can make more predictions more accurately and assess them with our better (human) judgment. Once managers can separate tasks into components of prediction and judgment, we can begin to understand how to optimize the interface between humans and machines. More than just an account of AI\u2019s powerful capabilities,\u00a0 \u00a0shows managers how they can most effectively leverage AI, disrupting business as usual only where required, and provides businesses with a toolkit to navigate the coming wave of challenges and opportunities.",

He is the author of two books on Asia and technology, and his writing has appeared in publications such as Financial Times, Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, Foreign Affairs, Asian Wall Street Journal, and International Herald Tribune. He has appeared as a commentator on several networks including Bloomberg, CNN, NBC, NPR, and the BBC. For more than three hundred years, the world wrestled with conflicts that arose between nation-states. Nation-states wielded military force, financial pressure, and diplomatic persuasion to create \u201cworld order.\u201d Even after the end of the Cold War, the elements comprising world order remained essentially unchanged. But 2012 marked a transformation in geopolitics and the tactics of both the established powers and smaller entities looking to challenge the international community. That year, the US government revealed its involvement in Operation \u201cOlympic Games,\u201d a mission aimed at disrupting the Iranian nuclear program through cyberattacks; Russia and China conducted massive cyber-espionage operations; and the world split over the governance of the Internet. Cyberspace became a battlefield. Cyber conflict is hard to track, often delivered by proxies, and has outcomes that are hard to gauge. It demands that the rules of engagement be completely reworked and all the old niceties of diplomacy be recast. Many of the critical resources of statecraft are now in the hands of the private sector, giant technology companies in particular. In this new world order, cybersecurity expert Adam Segal reveals, power has been well and truly hacked.",
